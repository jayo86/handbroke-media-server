⚠️ Highly recommend adjusting payments to PayPal, as there's a report of nzbgeek being hacked back in 2020, where PayPal users were unaffected. (Also nzbgeek payments will appear as 'GEEKHUBPTYL' instead of 'GREEN GOAT GAMING')

ℹ️ If you're finding that you're often getting 'Articles Missing', another provider to consider is [Eweka](https://www.eweka.nl/en) (Eweka pricing- €9.50/~$17AUD monthly) for more dependable downloads, see [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/4sp83k/could_someone_explain_what_retention_actually_is/) for explanation of article retention (think of the articles as the ingredients for the pizzas in the pizza shop analogy, they go stale and they're chucked out and not always replaced).
